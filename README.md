GeomeLearn
GeomeLearn, Learn about geometry with an Augmented Reality!

### What is GeomeLearn 🤔
Children oftenly hard to understand geometric objects, from their characteristics, appearance, and also the mathematical calculation of their volume or Total surface area. GeoLearn is an APP to solve those problem. By using Apple Framework such as RealityKit and ARKit, we can represent an interactive AR Object for them to interact with.

### Tech Stack 👨🏽‍💻
- `SwiftUI` - Simpler code and seamless User Interface System 
- `RealityKit` - Render and simulate usdz file in real life
- `ARKit` - Works with the implementation of RealityKit by, ARKit will provide real word surfaces, tracking, and other informations
- `Reality Composer` - Create Usdz files for the 3D assets

### How to Use 💻
1. Download the .zip file and extract it
2. Open and Run the .swiftpm file in Ipad Playgrounds app, preferably in Portrait Orientation
3. Choose the 3D Objects you want to view
4. Use X button to cancel, use the eye button to confirm and view the object
5. Don't forget to see detail and explanation in ? button
6. You can interact with the 3D Object! Move and resize with one finger, rotate with two finger
7. Delete the 3D object by a long press gesture on it

### Troubleshooting ⚙️
Sometimes the 3D Objects need time to appear, make sure you have good lighting. If this problem persists, you can restart the App.
